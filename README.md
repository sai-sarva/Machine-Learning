# Machine-Learning Projects

This repository contains Machine Learning Projects sourced from Kaggle and other diverse datasets. These projects
involve the development of Machine Learning models using advanced techniques such as exploring and analyzing the data,
transforming and cleaning it to make it suitable for analysis.

Each project is organized into separate folders, with the corresponding notebooks and datasets included. These folders
contain the code and files that were used to create and train the Machine Learning models. The datasets used for these
projects are also included within their respective folders.

Throughout the projects, various Machine Learning techniques are employed to make predictions and gain insights from the
data. Additionally, exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques are utilized to better understand the dataset's
characteristics, while data cleansing and transformation techniques (ELT) are applied to ensure the data is accurate and
suitable for analysis.
